Tokenomics
How does the Candycake token smart contract transfer function work?

CandyCake is a BEP-20 token on the Binance Smart Chain. It works like all other BEP-20 tokens, but also includes some additional features in its transfer function. These features are Reflection, Liquidity Pool (LP) Acquisition and Burn:

    Reflection: Holders earn passive rewards through static reflection as their balance of Candycake grows.
    Liquidity Pool (LP) Acquisition: A percentage of all transfer transactions is added to the PancakeSwap liquidity pool.
    Burn: Renouncing contract ownership resulted in a percentage of ongoing converted LP being sent to the BSC burn address.

Every token transfer incurs a 11% fee.
Fee breakdown

    Reflection: 5% of the fee is distributed to all token holders in proportion to their token holdings. CandyCake token balances have two different calculations: The first balance calculation is based on the traditional fixed number of tokens associated with a user’s address; The second balance calculation represents a user’s balance as a proportion of the total supply of the token:
    This second calculation works similarly to how dynamic rebasing mechanisms work . When a taxed transaction occurs, the % re-distributed to token holders is deducted from the total “proportional” supply. As a result, the users’ percentage of the total supply increases.
    Liquidity Pool Acquisition: 3% of the fee is to provide liquidity on PancakeSwap;
    1% is set to the Community marketing wallet and we burn again that 1 % .

Incentives

    Reflection: Holding the token long-term will result in redistribution rewards automatically added to a holder’s wallet.
    LP acquisition: Selling results in a transfer fee that helps support and stabilize the price of the token.
    Deflation: The burning of a portion of CAKE-LP serves as a deflationary function, meaning the total supply will gradually reduce, further increasing the rarity of tokens and price potential.

Note: Because of this special transaction function, it is recommended that traders set their slippage tolerance to around 10%+.
‘SwapAndLiquify’ function explained

    After each transaction, a fee is charged and sent to the contract balance. When the contract balance reaches the ‘numTokensSellToAddToLiquidity’ amount, the following transaction will call the function ‘SwapAndLiquify’ which divides the contract balance in half; one part is swapped for WBNB and the second half remain in Candy Cake tokens. These two halves are then paired together and added to liquidity on PancakeSwap.

Go back to the site or app where you purchased BNB and send it to your MetaMask wallet address (it is located near the top and looks something like ‘0x5e28c100249b50d89a0dde4e5ea04dbcbc30b12f’ ~ it is highly recommended that you copy and paste it directly, rather than inputting each character manually to avoid mistakes and financial loss)

Go to PancakeSwap: https://pancakeswap.finance/swap#/swap

Click ‘Select a currency’ in the ‘To’ box and input the CandyCake Token Community contract address: 0x5e28c100249b50d89a0dde4e5ea04dbcbc30b12f

Click ‘CandyCake’ and verify it is the correct token

Input the amount of BNB you want to spend or tokens you would like to acquire (make sure you leave enough BNB in your wallet for tx/gas fees)
-Important: Set slippage to around 11%.

After purchasing Candycake, open your MetaMask wallet, make sure you are connected to the Binance Smart Chain network (drop down near the top right, next to your account icon), click the ‘Assets’ tab and then ‘Add Token’

Copy and paste the CandyCake contract address: 0x5e28c100249b50d89a0dde4e5ea04dbcbc30b12f
